    <h2 id="step-to-uknown">Step to Unknown</h2>
    <p>Life rarely happens as predicted, given that we will never be able to anticipate everything. At no point can we have full control of external events. Staying in the realm of comfort and self-confirming practice makes us fragile and unable to thrive in the ever-changing universe.</p>
    <p>Together, we can create an environment where instead of stabilizing the state of events, we ground ourselves in an unstable flow of things and embrace the unknown, expanding the horizons by doing things we struggle with.</p>

    <h2 id="concept--proposal">Concept &amp; Proposal</h2>
